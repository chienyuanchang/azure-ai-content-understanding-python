### Local environment
1. Make sure the following tools are installed:

    * [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://aka.ms/install-azd)
    * [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    * [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/)

2. Make a new directory called `azure-ai-content-understanding-python` and clone this template into it using the `azd` CLI:
    ```
    azd init -t azure-ai-content-understanding-python
    ```
    You can also use git to clone the repository if you prefer.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-ai-content-understanding-python.git
    cd azure-ai-content-understanding-python
    ```
    - **Important:** If you use `git clone`, make sure to install Git LFS and run `git lfs pull` to download sample files in the `data` directory:

      ```shell
      git lfs install
      git lfs pull
      ```
3. Set Dev container Environment
  - Install tools that support dev containers
    - **Visual Studio Code**  
        Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

    - **Dev Containers Extension**  
      In the VS Code extension marketplace, install the extension named "Dev Containers".\
      (The extension was previously called "Remote - Containers", but has since been renamed and integrated into Dev Containers.)

    - **Docker**  
      Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (available for Windows, macOS, and Linux).\
      Docker is used to manage and run the container environment.  
      - Start Docker and ensure it is running in the background.

  - Open the project and start the Dev Container
    - Open the project folder with VS Code.
    - Press `F1` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`, type and select:
      ```
      Dev Containers: Reopen in Container
      ```
      Or click the green icon in the lower left corner of VS Code and select "Reopen in Container".
    - VS Code will automatically detect the `.devcontainer` folder, build the development container, and install the necessary dependencies.

## Configure Azure AI service resource
### (Option 1) Use `azd` commands to auto create temporal resources to run sample
1. Make sure you have permission to grant roles under subscription
1. Login Azure
    ```shell
    azd auth login
    ```
    If the previous command doesn’t work, try the following one and follow the on-screen instructions.
    ```
    azd auth login --use-device-code
    ```

1. Setting up environment, following prompts to choose location
    ```shell
    azd up
    ```


### (Option 2) Manually create resources and set environment variables
1. Create [Azure AI Services resource](docs/create_azure_ai_service.md)
2. Go to `Access Control (IAM)` in resource, grant yourself role `Cognitive Services User`
    - It's necessary even you are the owner of the resource
3. Copy `notebooks/.env.sample` to `notebooks/.env`
4. Fill **AZURE_AI_ENDPOINT** with the endpoint from your Azure portal Azure AI Services instance.
5. Login Azure
   ```shell
   azd auth login
   ```

## Open a Jupyter notebook and follow the step-by-step guidance

Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and select the sample notebook you are interested in. Since the Dev Container (in Codespaces or in your local enviornment) is pre-configured with the necessary environment, you can directly execute each step in the notebook.

1. Select one of the notebooks of interest in the notebooks/ directory. We recommend you to start with "content_extraction.ipynb" to understand the basic concepts.
![Select *.ipynb](/docs/create-codespace/2-Select%20file.ipynb.png)
1. Select Kernel

## Features

Azure AI Content Understanding is a new Generative AI-based [Azure AI service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-understanding/overview), designed to process/ingest content of any type (documents, images, audio, and video) into a user-defined output format. Content Understanding offers a streamlined process to reason over large amounts of unstructured data, accelerating time-to-value by generating an output that can be integrated into automation and analytical workflows.

## Samples

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [content_extraction.ipynb](notebooks/content_extraction.ipynb) | In this sample we will show content understanding API can help you get semantic information from your file. For example OCR with table in document, audio transcription, and face analysis in video. |
| [field_extraction.ipynb](notebooks/field_extraction.ipynb) | In this sample we will show how to create an analyzer to extract fields in your file. For example invoice amount in the document, how many people in an image, names mentioned in an audio, or summary of a video. You can customize the fields by creating your own analyzer template.  |
| [conversational_field_extraction.ipynb](notebooks/conversational_field_extraction.ipynb) | This sample shows you how to evaluate conversational audio data that has previously been transcribed with Content Understanding or Azure AI Speech in in an efficient way to optimize processing quality. This also allows you to re-analyze data in a cost-efficient way. This sample is based on the [field_extraction.ipynb](notebooks/field_extraction.ipynb) sample. |
| [analyzer_training.ipynb](notebooks/analyzer_training.ipynb) | If you want to futher boost the performance for field extraction, we can do training when you provide few labeled samples to the API. Note: This feature is available to document scenario now. |
| [management.ipynb](notebooks/management.ipynb) | This sample will demo how to create a minimal analyzer, list all the analyzers in your resource, and delete the analyzer you don't need. |
| [build_person_directory.ipynb](notebooks/build_person_directory.ipynb) | This sample will demo how to enroll people’s faces from images and build a Person Directory. | |
